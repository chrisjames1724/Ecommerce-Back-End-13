# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

# Description
In this assignment we were building the back end for an e-commerce site. We were given starter code and needed to build out the models according to the requirements listed on the module 13 challenge page through Bootcamp Spot.  This assignment was supposed to reinforce what we learned about building out models as well as writing routes. As this was not to be deployed, we tested out these routes using insomnia.
